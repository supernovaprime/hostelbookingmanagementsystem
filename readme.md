# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design and develop a **mobile-based Hostel Booking Management System** supported by a **Node.js + Express backend and MongoDB database**, enabling tenants to easily book hostels, managers to efficiently manage hostels and rooms, and super admins to oversee the platform, while providing **smart, user-friendly, and scalable features** tailored to the Ghanaian context.

## Specific Objectives

### 1. Mobile-Centered Booking Experience
- Build a React + TypeScript mobile app for tenants to search, view, and book hostels easily.
- Display real-time hostel and room availability to prevent conflicts.
- Support QR code scanning at **hostel level**, redirecting users to hostel pages or app download links.

### 2. Role-Based Access and Management
- Implement three distinct roles:  
  1. **Super Admin**: Oversees the platform, manages hostel managers, monitors analytics, resolves disputes.  
  2. **Hostel Manager**: Manages individual hostels, rooms, bookings, payments, and maintenance.  
  3. **Tenant**: Browses hostels, books rooms, submits maintenance requests, and provides feedback.
- Enforce role-based access control for secure and structured system usage.

### 3. Hostel & Room Management Automation
- Allow hostel managers to create and update hostel profiles, add rooms, set prices, and manage availability.
- Support temporary room blocking for maintenance or renovations.
- Generate unique **hostel QR codes** for offline-to-online discovery.

### 4. Booking & Payment Management
- Tenants can book rooms, track booking status, and view payment history.
- Managers can approve/reject bookings, monitor payments, and generate receipts.
- Super Admin can view platform-wide booking and revenue analytics.

### 5. Maintenance & Facility Requests
- Tenants can submit maintenance requests with optional photo attachments.
- Managers can track, assign, and resolve maintenance issues efficiently.
- Notifications alert tenants and managers on status updates.

### 6. Smart and Value-Added Features
- Recommend hostels or rooms based on tenant preferences and budget.
- Display vacancy countdowns to improve planning for tenants and managers.
- Collect tenant ratings and reviews post-stay to improve hostel service quality.

### 7. Communication & Notification System
- Send in-app and push notifications for booking confirmations or rejections, payment reminders, check-in/check-out alerts, and maintenance updates.

### 8. System Security, Reliability & Scalability
- Implement secure authentication and JWT-based role access.
- Hash passwords and validate inputs to prevent security breaches.
- Design the system to scale for multiple hostels, users, and future expansions.

### 9. Academic and Portfolio Objectives
- Apply real-world mobile and backend development concepts using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Build a professional, production-ready system suitable for portfolio, academic evaluation, or potential commercialization.

## Summary
The project aims to develop a **secure, scalable, and Ghana-friendly mobile hostel booking system** that automates hostel operations, enforces role-based management, enhances tenant experience, and provides managers and admins with actionable analytics and control.
